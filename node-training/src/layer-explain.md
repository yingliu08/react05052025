1. Controller Layer
   Job: The controller layer manages incoming HTTP requests and outgoing responses. It acts as an intermediary between the client and the service layer.
   Responsibilities:
   Handle Requests: Receive HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and extract relevant parameters and data from the requests.
   Call Services: Invoke methods from the service layer to perform business logic or data operations.
   Send Responses: Format and send back appropriate HTTP responses to the client, including success messages or error responses.
   Error Handling: Manage errors (e.g., resource not found) and communicate them to the client in a user-friendly format.
2. Service Layer
   Job: The service layer contains the business logic of the application. It is where the core functionality is implemented without any direct knowledge of how the data is stored or retrieved.
   Responsibilities:
   Business Logic: Implement the rules and operations that govern the applicationâ€™s behavior (e.g., validation, data transformation).
   Data Manipulation: Interact with the data repository to create, read, update, or delete data. The service layer invokes repository methods to handle these tasks.
   Orchestration: Coordinate complex operations that may involve multiple repositories or other services.
   Return Data: Provide the controller with the final data required to form the response.
3. Data Repository Layer
   Job: The data repository layer is responsible for data persistence and retrieval. It abstracts the specifics of data storage and access, providing a clean interface for the service layer.
   Responsibilities:
   Data Access: Interact with data sources (e.g., databases, file systems) to perform CRUD operations.
   Encapsulation: Hide the details of the underlying data storage, such as SQL queries or data models, so the service layer does not have to deal with them directly.
   Data Integrity: Ensure that the operations on the data are valid and comply with the application's constraints and rules.
   Transform Data (Optional): Convert data between its storage format and the format used by the application, if necessary.
